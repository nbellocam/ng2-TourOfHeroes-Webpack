# Tour Of Heroes using webpack

This is the sample solution used in the [Angular 2 tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) but it was created using webpack instead of system.js

You can find the base app at master (as this could be used as a simple entry point/boilerplate) and then a branch for each of the chapters of the tutorial that contains the end solution for that chapter.
